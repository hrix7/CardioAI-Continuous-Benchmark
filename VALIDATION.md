# Starter validation record

Validated locally on November 11, 2026 (America/Phoenix), using Python 3.11.0 on macOS.

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 8 tests passed.
- `python3 pipeline.py`: generated all synthetic artifacts successfully.
- `python3 pipeline.py --verify`: independent recomputation and artifact checksums matched.
- `actionlint 1.7.12 -no-color .github/workflows/daily.yml`: passed with no findings. Shellcheck was not installed; actionlint's optional shellcheck integration was therefore unavailable.
- Pinned checkout v4.2.2, setup-python v5.6.0 and upload-artifact v4.6.2 SHAs matched their official GitHub tag references.

Tests cover deterministic recomputation, finite metrics, deliberate artifact tampering, project-specific mathematical behavior, and workflow permission/publishing policy. No remote GitHub Actions execution has been observed yet. Local success does not establish clinical validity or guarantee platform-identical floating-point bytes. CI generates and verifies results in the same runtime before publication.

The daily workflow schedules execution and report verification; it does not schedule autonomous source-code development. Repository creation and the first remote push are required to activate it.
